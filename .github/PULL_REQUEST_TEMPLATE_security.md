# Security Hardening for v1.0.3 Release

## 🎯 Overview

This PR implements comprehensive security hardening measures for Rolodink, addressing critical security concerns and preparing the application for production deployment.

## ✅ Changes

### Rate Limiting
- ✅ Added rate limiting (100 requests/hour per IP) to all API routes
- ✅ Implemented `rateLimitMiddleware` utility
- ✅ Applied to 8 API endpoints:
  - `/api/auth/signin`
  - `/api/auth/signup`
  - `/api/connections`
  - `/api/connections/[id]`
  - `/api/user/delete`
  - `/api/user/export`
  - `/api/version`

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ Created SQL migration for RLS policies (`enable_rls.sql`)
- ✅ Enabled RLS on `Connection` and `Note` tables
- ✅ Policies enforce `auth.uid() = ownerId` for all operations
- ✅ Prevents cross-user data access at database level

### Secret Management
- ✅ Removed hardcoded placeholder secrets from `config.ts`
- ✅ Added validation warnings for missing environment variables
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to ensure secrets are never committed

### Security Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive `docs/SECURITY.md`
- ✅ Added `docs/RLS_SETUP.md` with setup and testing guide
- ✅ Added `docs/ENV_SETUP.md` for environment configuration
- ✅ Created `docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md` with security checklist

### CI/CD Security
- ✅ Added `npm audit` to CI/CD workflows
- ✅ Added `.github/workflows/secret-scanning.yml` (TruffleHog)
- ✅ Updated `.cursorrules` with security best practices

- **New files**: 6 (rate-limit.ts, enable_rls.sql, 4 docs)
- **Modified files**: 16

## 🧪 Testing Done

- [x] Rate limiting tested locally (returns 429 after 100 requests)
- [x] RLS SQL migration syntax verified
- [x] npm audit runs successfully in CI/CD
- [x] TruffleHog scan: 0 secrets detected
- [x] All API routes compile without errors

## ⚠️ Before Merge

### Critical Actions Required

1. **RLS Migration**: 
   - [ ] Execute `prisma/migrations/enable_rls.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
   - [ ] Verify policies are active: `SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables...`
   - [ ] Test RLS by attempting cross-user data access

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - [ ] Verify all secrets are set in Vercel dashboard
   - [ ] Check `docs/ENV_SETUP.md` for required variables
   - [ ] Test backend connects to Supabase successfully

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - [ ] Test rate limiting after deployment
   - [ ] Verify 429 responses include proper headers
   - [ ] Monitor for false positives

### Post-Merge Deployment

1. [ ] Deploy to Vercel (automatic on merge to main)
2. [ ] Verify rate limiting works in production
3. [ ] Run RLS migration in Supabase production database
4. [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end
5. [ ] Monitor logs for security warnings

## 📝 Notes

- Rate limiting uses in-memory store (will reset on serverless cold starts)
- Consider Redis for distributed rate limiting at scale
- RLS migration must be run manually in Supabase (not via Prisma)
