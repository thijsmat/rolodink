## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Error: "Version must be higher than current"

**Solution:**
- Current version in store is v1.0.2 (or higher)
- You're uploading v1.0.3
- If error persists, check manifest.json version in ZIP
- Verify: `unzip -p rolodink-v1.0.3-chrome.zip manifest.json | jq .version`

### Error: "Icon not found"

**Solution:**
- Verify `icon.png` exists in ZIP root
- Verify `icons/icon16.png`, `icon32.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png` exist
- Check manifest.json icon paths are correct
- Run: `unzip -l rolodink-v1.0.3-chrome.zip | grep icon`

### Error: "Manifest invalid"

**Solution:**
- Validate JSON syntax: `jq . manifest.json`
- Check required fields present (name, version, manifest_version)
- Verify manifest_version is 3
- Run: `npm run validate` in extension directory

### Error: "Package too large"

**Solution:**
- Chrome Web Store limit: 10 MB
- Our ZIP is ~149 KB (well under limit)
- If you see this error, something is wrong
- Verify ZIP contains only runtime files (no node_modules, docs, etc.)

### Error: "Permission not justified"

**Solution:**
- Chrome may ask for permission justifications
- Go to "Privacy practices" tab
- Add clear explanations for each permission
- See `SUBMISSION.md` Step 4 for examples

### Upload Fails Completely

**Solutions:**
- Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
- Clear browser cache
- Check internet connection
- Verify ZIP file is not corrupted
- Try smaller ZIP first (test upload)
