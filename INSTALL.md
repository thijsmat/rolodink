# Install Rolodink from GitHub Releases

Rolodink is pending Chrome Web Store approval. You can install it manually from GitHub Releases in the meantime.

## Download
- Go to the Releases page of this repository.
- Download the asset named like `Rolodink-X.Y.Z.zip` (the highest version is recommended).

## Install (Chrome)
1. Extract the ZIP to a folder on your computer (e.g., `~/Rolodink-X.Y.Z`).
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top-right).
4. Click "Load unpacked".
5. Select the extracted folder.

## Security warnings
- Chrome may warn about developer modeâ€”this is expected when sideloading.

- Click the extension icon; the popup should show the Rolodink UI.
- Version should match the release you downloaded.

## Updating
- Remove or disable the old loaded folder in `chrome://extensions`.
- Download the new `Rolodink-X.Y.Z.zip`, extract, and "Load unpacked" again.
- Alternatively, keep the same folder path and replace its contents, then click "Update" in `chrome://extensions`.

## Uninstalling

- Find Rolodink and click "Remove".

## Troubleshooting
- "Manifest version not supported": update Chrome to the latest stable.
